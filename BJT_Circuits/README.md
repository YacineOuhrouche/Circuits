## 📐 Circuit Overviews

### 💡 LED Flasher
**What It Does:**  
A **LED flasher** circuit that uses two **transistor** to blink an LED in a periodic fashion.  
The frequency of the blinking is controlled by the resistors and capacitors in the circuit.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **Capacitor charging and discharging**
- **Transistor switching**
- **Timing circuits**

### 📡 Rectifier
**What It Does:**  
This project demonstrates a **transistor amplifier**, which amplifies weak signals (like audio signals) into a stronger, usable output. The circuit uses a **NPN transistor** in a common-emitter configuration.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **Signal amplification**
- **Biasing of transistor** for proper operation
- **Resistor-capacitor network** for filtering and amplification
