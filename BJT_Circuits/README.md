## 📐 Circuit Overviews

### 💡 LED Flasher
**What It Does:**  
This circuit uses two **BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)** to blink an LED in a periodic fashion.  
The flashing rate is determined by resistors and capacitors, creating a basic **astable multivibrator**.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **Capacitor charging and discharging**
- **Transistor switching**
- **Timing circuits**

### ⚡ Rectifier
**What It Does:**  
This project demonstrates a **Half-Wave Rectifier** circuit, which converts **AC voltage** into **pulsating DC voltage**. It works by allowing only the positive half of the AC waveform to pass through a diode, while blocking the negative half.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **AC to DC conversion**
- **Diode as a one-way current valve**
- **Basic rectification principle**

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **LTspice** for schematic drawing and simulation
- **Falstad Circuit Simulator** for quick online testing
- **Breadboard** for real-world implementation

## Why Diodes?

Diodes are essential in rectifiers because they only allow current to flow in **one direction**. This property makes them perfect for converting **AC (Alternating Current)** into **DC (Direct Current)**. Rectifier circuits are found in nearly every power supply, from phone chargers to industrial equipment.
