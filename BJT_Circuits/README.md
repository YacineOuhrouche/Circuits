# 🔌 Analog Circuits

Welcome to the **Analog Circuits** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **basic analog circuits** using components like **diodes, resistors, capacitors, and transistors**. Analog circuits are those where signals vary continuously and are used to process a wide range of information, such as sound, light, temperature, and other real-world phenomena. Unlike digital circuits, which deal with binary values (0s and 1s), analog circuits deal with continuous signal variations, making them crucial for real-world applications.

### 💡 LED Flasher
**What It Does:**  
This circuit uses two **BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)** to blink an LED in a periodic fashion.  
The flashing rate is determined by resistors and capacitors, creating a basic **astable multivibrator**.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **Capacitor charging and discharging**
- **Transistor switching**
- **Timing circuits**

### ⚡ Rectifier
**What It Does:**  
This project demonstrates a **Half-Wave Rectifier** circuit, which converts **AC voltage** into **pulsating DC voltage**. It works by allowing only the positive half of the AC waveform to pass through a diode, while blocking the negative half.

**Core Concepts:**  
- **AC to DC conversion**
- **Diode as a one-way current valve**
- **Basic rectification principle**
