## 📐 Rectifier Overviews

### 🔹 Half-Wave Rectifier

**What It Does:**  
- Allows only **one half-cycle** (positive or negative) of AC to pass, blocking the other half.
- Simple but inefficient.

**What You’ll Find in the Folder:**  
✅ Schematic (LTspice or hand-drawn)  
✅ Simulation (AC input vs DC output waveform)  
✅ Breadboard image  
✅ Explanation (theory, peak voltage, ripple)

### 🔹 Full-Wave Rectifier (Center Tap)

**What It Does:**  
- Uses a center-tapped transformer and **two diodes** to rectify **both halves** of AC.
- More efficient than half-wave.

**What You’ll Find in the Folder:**  
✅ Schematic (LTspice or hand-drawn)  
✅ Simulation (AC input vs DC output waveform)  
✅ Breadboard image  
✅ Explanation (voltage calculations, diode operation)
