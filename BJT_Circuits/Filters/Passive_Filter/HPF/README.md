# 🎛️ High Pass Filter

Welcome to the **High Pass Filter** project repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates how to design and build a **High Pass Filter (HPF)** — a fundamental circuit in analog electronics.

---

## 🧰 What is a High Pass Filter?

A **High Pass Filter** is an electronic circuit that **allows high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating (blocking) low-frequency signals**. It acts like a "frequency gate," only letting the higher frequencies (like treble tones in audio) get through.

---

## 🛠️ What Does It Do?

The High Pass Filter is often used to:

✅ Remove low-frequency noise or hum from signals  
✅ Allow high-frequency components (e.g., high-pitched audio) to pass  
✅ Filter out unwanted low-frequency signals from sensors or audio equipment

## ⚙️ Circuit Explanation

This is a **passive RC high pass filter**, built using just:

- **A resistor (R)**
- **A capacitor (C)**
