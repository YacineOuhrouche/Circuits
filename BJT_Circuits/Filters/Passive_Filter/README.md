# 📡 Passive Filters: An Introduction

Welcome to the **Passive Filters** resource page! 🎉  
This page explains **what passive filters are**, how they work, and provides links to explore each type of filter in detail.

## ⚙️ What Are Passive Filters?

**Passive Filters** are electronic circuits that filter specific frequency ranges from a signal.  
They do this **without requiring any external power source**, relying only on the **natural frequency response** of passive components: resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

## 🔗 Explore Each Filter

| Filter Type | Description | Link |
|--|--|--|
| 🎚️ Low Pass Filter | Passes low frequencies, blocks high frequencies | [Low Pass Filter](./LP_Filter/) |
| 🎚️ High Pass Filter | Passes high frequencies, blocks low frequencies | [High Pass Filter](./HPF/) |
| 🎚️ Band Pass Filter | Passes only a specific band of frequencies | [Band Pass Filter](./BPF/) |
| 🎚️ Band Stop Filter | Blocks a specific band of frequencies | [Band Stop Filter](./BSF/) |
