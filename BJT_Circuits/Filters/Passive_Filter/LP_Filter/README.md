# 🎛️ Low Pass Filter

Welcome to the **Low Pass Filter** project repository! 🎉  
This project demonstrates how to design and build a **Low Pass Filter (LPF)** — a fundamental circuit in analog electronics.

---

## 🧰 What is a Low Pass Filter?

A **Low Pass Filter** is an electronic circuit that **allows low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating (blocking) high-frequency signals**. It acts like a "frequency gate," only letting the lower frequencies (like bass tones in audio) get through.

---

## 🛠️ What Does It Do?

The Low Pass Filter is often used to:

✅ Remove high-frequency noise from signals  
✅ Smooth out rapid changes in sensor signals  
✅ Extract the DC component from mixed signals (like audio or control systems)

## ⚙️ Circuit Explanation

This is a **passive RC low pass filter**, built using just:

- **A resistor (R)**
- **A capacitor (C)**

## 📊 Simulation Results

### Frequency Response (Bode Plot)
The filter’s **gain decreases** as frequency increases.
