# Two-Transistor LED Flasher Circuit

## 📝 What It Does

This circuit uses a **two-transistor astable multivibrator** to flash two LEDs alternately. It’s a simple oscillator built with two NPN transistors that charges and discharges a capacitor to alternate the LEDs' states.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Q1** and **Q2** are NPN transistors.
- When one transistor turns ON, the other turns OFF.
- The **capacitor** allows the transistors to switch alternately, making the LEDs blink in sequence.
- The resistors control the timing of the oscillation.
