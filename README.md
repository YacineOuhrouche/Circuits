# ⚡ Circuits Collection

Welcome to my **Circuits** repository!  

This collection showcases circuits I’ve designed, simulated, and documented during my studies in **Electrical Engineering** and **Digital Logic Design**. Each folder includes:

✅ Circuit Schematic (PNG/PDF)  
✅ Simulation Files (LTspice, Falstad, Proteus)  
✅ Explanation (How It Works)
