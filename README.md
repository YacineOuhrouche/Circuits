# Circuits Collection

Welcome to my **Circuits** repository! This collection showcases the hands-on circuits I’ve designed and simulated during my studies in **Electrical Engineering** and **Digital Logic Design**. Each folder contains:

✅ Circuit Schematic (PNG/PDF)  
✅ Simulation Files (LTspice, falstad)
✅ Explanation (How It Works)  
✅ External References (Datasheets)
