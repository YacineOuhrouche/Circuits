# Logic Circuits Using Transistors

Welcome to the **Logic Circuits Using Transistors** repository! üéâ  
This folder showcases how basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND) can be **built using transistors** (BJT).

Each folder contains:

‚úÖ A short explanation of what the gate does  
‚úÖ A link to more information  
‚úÖ  A schematic image
